# Emotion Detection App

## Overview
The Emotion Detection App is a web-based application that uses deep learning to recognize human emotions from facial expressions. Built with **Flask**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow**, the app supports multiple input methods including image upload, video upload, and real-time webcam feed.

It leverages a pre-trained convolutional neural network model to classify facial emotions in various input formats.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Detect emotions in static images.
- **Video Upload**: Analyze emotions frame by frame in a video.
- **Webcam Mode**: Real-time emotion detection using your webcam.
- **Live Feed**: Continuous facial emotion recognition through a live video stream.
